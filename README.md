# Flight Price Prediction Determining Optimal Timing for Purchasing Plane Tickets

### Research Question
> When is the best time to purchase plane tickets for optimal pricing?

### Rationale
> Given how rapidly airline ticket rates change, it can be difficult for travellers to decide when to buy their tickets. When planning and scheduling their flights, travellers can save money by being aware about the trends and factors that affect ticket pricing.

### Source of Data Collection:
The dataset used for this project is extracted from the website "Easymytrip" which contains flight travel data between some of India's largest cities. **Shubham Bathwal**, the author of the dataset, used scraiping tools to collect data from the website which includes more than 300,000 datapoints.

### Data information:
The collected data includes airlines, flight codes, source and destination cities, departure and arrival times, number of stops, seat class information, duration of flight, days before flight, and ticket fares.

### Targeted Variable:
The ticket fares is the targeted variable because the goal is to find the optimal timing to purchase flight tickets.

### Method of Analysis:
The statistical algorithm used to train the dataset and predict data is Linear Regression. This will have a predictative model developed that can estimate future ticket prices based on identified patterns from historical data
